### Description

PinPoint is a web app that allows users to create surveys to collect feeback from customers on their services/products. Those surveys are then sent out to all of the listed recipients via SendGrid. User can see the results of their surveys displayed on their dashboard. 

Check out [PinPoint](http://vast-earth-52435.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku -- [CLICK HERE](http://vast-earth-52435.herokuapp.com/)

I built this app as part of my exploration into the world of React, Redux, Node.js, & MongoDB. PinPoint features the following: 
* User login with Google and Facebook Oauth handled by PassportJS
* Cookie based authentication
* Credit card payments handled through Stripe
* Wizard forms using Redux Form
* Email click & event handling using SendGridâ€™s Event Webhook
* An Express server handling interaction with MongoDB via Mongoose
* A user interface built with Sass & CSS Grid 
* Written primary with ES2017 syntax
* And all that [deployed to Heroku](http://vast-earth-52435.herokuapp.com/)!
